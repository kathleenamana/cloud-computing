## 1. Introduction

NexusDocs is a proof-of-concept for a real-time collaborative document editing platform designed to demonstrate the application of distributed systems and cloud computing principles. It aims to provide a highly available, scalable, and fault-tolerant environment for teams to create and manage documents collaboratively.

## 2. Problem Statement

Modern collaborative workflows are often hampered by issues such as version conflicts, lack of real-time synchronization, limited accessibility, and inadequate audit trails. Traditional document management solutions struggle to provide the necessary scalability, fault tolerance, and granular access control required by dynamic teams. These challenges lead to decreased productivity, increased operational overhead, and potential data loss.

## 3. Service Description

- NexusDocs addresses these challenges by offering a robust platform with the following key features:

- Real-time Collaborative Editing: Multiple users can simultaneously edit documents, with changes instantly propagated to all collaborators.
- Comprehensive Version Control: A detailed history of all changes, allowing users to track modifications, compare versions, and revert to any previous state.
- Robust Access Management: Fine-grained permissions (owner, editor, viewer) to control document access and ensure data security.
- Scalable Storage: Documents and their version histories are stored securely and redundantly across a distributed infrastructure.
- Health Monitoring: Endpoints for checking the health and statistics of the distributed system.

## 4. Distributed Systems & Cloud Computing

NexusDocs is built upon core distributed systems concepts and designed for cloud deployment to ensure its key promises:

### Scalability

- Horizontal Scaling: The application is designed to scale horizontally by adding more instances of the Flask application servers. This is managed by Docker Compose in this demonstration.
- Load Balancing: An Nginx load balancer distributes incoming requests across multiple application instances, preventing bottlenecks and ensuring consistent performance.
- Simulated Sharding: Document IDs are hashed to simulate data sharding across different logical database instances (represented by in-memory dictionaries in this PoC), distributing storage and I/O load.
- Microservices-like Structure: While a single Flask app, the design separates concerns (document management, versioning, access control) to illustrate how a microservices architecture would allow independent scaling.

### Fault Tolerance

- Simulated Replication: Documents are conceptually replicated across multiple 

nodes (with a replication factor of 3 in this simulation), ensuring data durability and availability even if some nodes fail.
- Stateless Application Servers: The Flask application servers are stateless, meaning they do not store session-specific data. This allows any available server to handle a user's request, making it easy to replace failed instances.

### Collaboration

- RESTful API: The service exposes a RESTful API for all operations, enabling real-time communication between clients and the backend.
- Centralized (Simulated) State: While the application is distributed, the in-memory dictionaries provide a centralized (though simulated) state for this PoC. In a real-world scenario, this would be replaced by a distributed database with strong consistency guarantees.

## 5. Architecture Overview

The architecture of this NexusDocs PoC consists of the following components:

1.  Nginx Load Balancer: A reverse proxy that distributes incoming traffic across the available application server instances using a round-robin algorithm.
2.  Flask Application Servers: Multiple instances of the Python Flask application, each running in its own Docker container. These servers handle the business logic for document management, versioning, and access control.
3.  In-Memory Data Store: Python dictionaries are used to simulate a distributed database, storing documents, versions, and access control information. This is for demonstration purposes only.
4.  Docker Compose: A tool for defining and running the multi-container Docker application, orchestrating the load balancer and application server instances.

## 6. Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
*   [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### Setup

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/nexusdocs.git
    cd nexusdocs
    ```

### Running the Application

1.  Build and run the application using Docker Compose:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

2.  The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:80`.

## 7. API Endpoints

The following API endpoints are available:

| Method | Endpoint                                  | Description                               |
| :----- | :---------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------- |
| GET    | `/api/health`                             | Health check for the service.             |
| POST   | `/api/document`                           | Create a new document.                    |
| GET    | `/api/document/<doc_id>`                  | Retrieve a document.                      |
| PUT    | `/api/document/<doc_id>`                  | Update a document.                        |
| GET    | `/api/document/<doc_id>/versions`         | Get all versions of a document.           |
| GET    | `/api/document/<doc_id>/version/<int:version_number>` | Get a specific version of a document.     |
| POST   | `/api/document/<doc_id>/access`           | Manage document access control.           |
| GET    | `/api/documents`                          | List all documents (with pagination).     |
| GET    | `/api/stats`                              | Get system statistics.                    |

## 8. Future Enhancements

- Real-time Collaboration with WebSockets: Implement WebSockets for true real-time, low-latency collaborative editing.
- Distributed Database: Replace the in-memory data store with a proper distributed database like Cassandra, CockroachDB, or a sharded PostgreSQL/MySQL setup.
- Authentication and Authorization: Implement a robust authentication and authorization system (e.g., OAuth2, JWT).
- Conflict Resolution: Implement OT (Operational Transformation) or CRDTs (Conflict-free Replicated Data Types) for robust conflict resolution during concurrent editing.
- Kubernetes Deployment: Deploy the application on a Kubernetes cluster for enhanced scalability, fault tolerance, and management.
